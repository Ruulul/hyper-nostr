## Usage
The goal of this tool is to behave as a public relay; think of the chosen topic as a public relay, where you can send and receive notes from your peers!
1. Install: `npm install -g hyper-nostr`
2. Run: `hyper-nostr [port [...starting topics]]` (default 3000)
    - Example: `hyper-nostr 3000 nostr`
3. Add your relay as `ws://localhost:[port]/[topic]` in your Nostr client (I am using `nostr` as a topic to make some kind of generic swarm) (topic is now optional; if you left it blank, it goes to `nostr`)
4. Setup done!
## HTTPS
The best way is to setup a reverse proxy. I use caddy, so then all I need to do is to run `caddy reverse-proxy --to localhost:[port]`.
Then I can add `wss://localhost` as a relay.

Browsers have the tendency to refuse self signed certificates. A workaround is to go to the reverse-proxy link `https://localhost` and "accept the risk". There is no page in that path, so you will see a blank page, but after that your browser client probably will accept it.
## How it works
Hyper-Nostr is a distributed nostr relay that syncs your relay storage and real time events through the [Hyperswarm](https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperswarm), linearizes the databases with [Autobase](https://github.com/holepunchto/autobase), and uses a [Hyperbeedee](https://github.com/Telios-org/hyperdeebee) database (loosely based on MongoDB).

The hyperswarm and cores management was highly abstracted thanks to [Hyper SDK](https://github.com/rangermauve/hyper-sdk).
## NIPs implemented
- [x] NIP-01 (mandatory nostr implementation)
- [x] NIP-02 (contact lists)
- [ ] NIP-04 (direct messages)
- [x] NIP-09 (event deletion)
- [x] NIP-11 (relay information)
- [x] NIP-12 (generic tag queries)
- [x] NIP-16 (event treatment)
- [x] NIP-20 (command results)
- [x] NIP-33 (parametrized replaceable events)
- [x] NIP-45 (event counts)
- [ ] NIP-50 (search)

## Code API
```js
import * as SDK from 'hyper-sdk'
/** (sdk: SDK.SDK, topic: string) => swarm object */
import createSwarm from 'hyper-nostr'
import goodbye from 'graceful-goodbye'

const yourStorageFolder = '.hyper-nostr-relay' // set to false to not persist
const theTopic = 'nostr'

const sdk = SDK.create({
    storage: yourStorageFolder
})
goodbye(_ => sdk.close())

const { 
    subscriptions, // a Map<subscriptionId: string, { filters: Filter[], socket: WebSocket, receivedEvents: Set<id: Number> }> object
    sendEvent, // (event: Event) => document: Object | Error | void; to send an Nostr Event to the peers and the local database.
    queryEvents, // (filters: Filter[]) => Promise<Event[]>; to query the database for the events that match the list of filters 
    sendQueryToSubscription, // (sub: Subscription, key: subscriptionId, opts: { hasLimit: Boolean }) => Promise<void> // Write the events to the socket; internally includes each id on receivedEvents and dont send duplicated events
    update // () => Promise<void>; manually sync the databases in the background
} = await createSwarm(sdk, theTopic)
```
## Server API
The client can send the following events through the websocket:
- REQ: Request and subscription event
    - Format: `["REQ", <subscription id>, <filters JSON>...]`
    - The server then adds the socket and the filters to the `subs` map
    - The server will send all the events that are on the database that matches the query, followed by a `["EOSE", <subscription id>]` event, signalling that all events from now on will be on real time
- EVENT: Send an event to the relay
    - Format: `["EVENT", <event JSON>]`
    - The server will use `sendEvent` to broadcast the event, and received events through this broadcast are internally validated and sent through the `subs` Map
    - The server confirms that the message was sent with an `["OK", <event id>, true, ""]` (NIP-20)
- CLOSE: Cancel a subscription
    - Format: `["CLOSE", <subscription id>]`
    - Cancels a subscription, removing it from the `subs` map
- COUNT: Counts the number of events that match a query (NIP-45)
    - Format: `["COUNT", <subscription id>, <filters JSON>...]`
    - Query and count events that match the filters sent in the same event

The server sends the following events:
- EOSE and OK specified above;
- EVENT: Sending an event that matches the filters of a subscription
    - Format: `["EVENT", <subscription id>, <event JSON>]`
- NOTICE: Reporting errors
    - Format: `["NOTICE", <message>]`
    - The only Notice this server implements is `"Unrecognized event"`, for when there is no match for the event kind sent.
